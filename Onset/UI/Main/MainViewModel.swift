/// View model for the main recording configuration screen (#36).
///
/// Owns device discovery, camera preview lifecycle, and the AC-2 record-button logic:
/// - (a) screen is the mandatory video source (MVP); display selected → button active; camera is optional
/// - (b) mic available but NOT selected → button disabled with message
/// - (c) mic unavailable → record without audio, «без звука» indicator
/// - (d) screen permission denied → empty state (return to onboarding)
///
/// ### Camera selection
/// `cameraPickerSelection` is the single source of truth for the camera device picker (#224).
/// `nil` represents "Выключена" (camera disabled); a non-nil `String` is the `uniqueID` of the
/// selected device. Setting it drives both `cameraEnabled` and `selectedCameraID`.
/// `cameraEnabled` remains a stored `var` for internal use by persistence, restore logic, and
/// `activeCamera`. `activeCamera` is the unified single predicate: non-nil iff `cameraEnabled`
/// is `true` AND a real camera is selected. Camera is NOT a factor in `canRecord` — screen is
/// always required.
///
/// ### Preview lifecycle
/// A generation counter (`previewGeneration`) drives `.id()` on `CameraPreviewRepresentable`
/// so SwiftUI recreates the NSView — and thus the `AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer` — whenever the
/// camera changes. The `CameraSource` actor for preview is started/stopped inside
/// `.task(id: activeCamera?.uniqueID)`. Old source MUST be stopped before a new one starts to
/// avoid device contention.
///
/// ### Camera-only recording (no screen)
/// Deferred post-MVP (decision B, issue #61). `RecordingRequest.display` is non-optional;
/// `RecordingSession` has no screen-skip branch. Screen capture is mandatory in MVP.
