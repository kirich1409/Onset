// swiftlint:disable file_length type_body_length
// Rationale: FileWriter is a single-responsibility actor. The extra length comes from its
// complete lifecycle (init / start / append / finish), telemetry task, test seams, and their
// inline doc comments. The telemetry flush task added for cadence telemetry is lifecycle-coupled
// to markFinished() — splitting it to an extension would scatter the cancel coupling.

// MARK: - FileWriter

/// Muxes compressed HEVC video (and optionally AAC audio) into an MP4 file.
///
/// FileWriter is a passthrough video muxer: it receives already-compressed HEVC samples
/// from `VideoEncoder` and writes them directly to the container without re-encoding.
/// Audio (raw PCM microphone) is encoded to AAC by `AVAssetWriter` itself.
///
/// ### Init contract — sourceFormatHint is REQUIRED for MP4 passthrough
///
/// `AVAssetWriterInput(outputSettings: nil)` instructs the input to pass compressed
/// samples through without re-encoding. For non-QuickTime containers (`.mp4`), a non-nil
/// `sourceFormatHint` is REQUIRED — the input cannot infer the media subtype from the first
/// appended sample buffer.
///
/// Empirically verified (probe run, 2026-06-04, macOS 26.5): building the passthrough video
/// input with a `nil` hint and adding it crashes the process at `AVAssetWriter.add(input:)` —
/// **before** `startWriting()` is ever reached — with an uncaught `NSInvalidArgumentException`:
///
///     *** -[AVAssetWriter addInput:] In order to perform passthrough to file type
///         public.mpeg-4, please provide a format hint in the AVAssetWriterInput initializer
///
/// This is a fatal Objective-C exception, not a recoverable `false` return or Swift `throw`,
/// so the nil case cannot be guarded by `FileWriterError.startFailed` — `start()` calls
/// `add()` before `startWriting()`, and the crash happens at `add()`. The hint must therefore
/// be non-optional. The with-hint path was verified to round-trip the encoder's `hvc1` subtype
/// through the muxer unchanged (`FileWriterLiveTests.liveEncode_fileContainsHEVCTrack`).
///
/// Therefore `sourceFormatHint` cannot be `nil` when writing MP4. Callers (#34
/// `RecordingSession`) must:
/// 1. Start `VideoEncoder` and await the first `EncodedSample` from `encodedSamples`.
/// 2. Extract `CMSampleBufferGetFormatDescription(sample.sampleBuffer)`.
/// 3. Construct `FileWriter(outputURL:configuration:includeAudio:sourceFormatHint:)` with
///    that description.
/// 4. Call `appendVideo(_:)` starting from the first sample (raw — no PTS conversion).
///
/// ### PTS contract — append raw, no conversion
/// `start(atSourceTime:)` establishes the timeline origin via `startSession(atSourceTime:)`.
/// `appendVideo` appends `sample.sampleBuffer` **raw** — adding a `PipelineClock.convert()`
/// call here would double-subtract the anchor offset and place samples before session start.
///
/// ### Lifecycle
///   `init` → `start(atSourceTime:)` → `appendVideo` / `appendAudio` → `markFinished()`
///   → `finish()`.
///
/// ### Drop channel
/// `drops` exposes writer-side backpressure events for `DropMonitor` (#35). The stream is
/// intentionally built here even though no consumer exists until #34/#35 — placing it now
/// is deliberate (matches `VideoEncoder`'s pattern) so the type contract is stable.
