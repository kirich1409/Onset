// U3 of #31 — the impure encoder actor: a single hardware HEVC `VTCompressionSession`
// per stream (screen / camera), CFR hold-frame normalisation, anchored-PTS snapping,
// backpressure gating, and a zero-copy IOSurface path.
//
// Layering: U1 `VTEncoderSettings` (EncoderConfigBuilder.swift) supplies rate/GOP/profile/
// color but NO width/height/fps — those come from the resolved capture plan as separate
// `init` params (session create needs w/h; the CFR grid needs fps). U2 `CFRNormalizer`
// (CFRNormalizer.swift) owns ALL slot dedup / hold / drop decisions; this actor only drives
// it with frame PTS (seconds) + ticks. The profile-level VT-constant mapping lives in the
// shared `HEVCProfileLevel.vtProfileLevel` extension (HEVCProfileLevel+VideoToolbox.swift).
// Seam types (`EncodedSampleSink`, `CompressionSession`, `VideoEncoderError`) are in
// VideoEncoderTypes.swift; the live `VTCompressionSession` wrapper is in
// VideoEncoder+LiveSession.swift.
//
// Isolation & memory safety: under `SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor`,
// `actor VideoEncoder` is explicit so the encoder runs off the main actor. Under
// `SWIFT_STRICT_MEMORY_SAFETY = YES` all VideoToolbox / CoreMedia C-interop is wrapped in
// `unsafe` (mirroring CapabilityProbe.swift). `VTCompressionSessionRef` is
// `CM_SWIFT_NONSENDABLE`: created and called ONLY inside the actor's session wrapper, never
// crossing an isolation boundary. The C output callback fires on VT's internal queue and
// recovers a SEPARATE `EncodedSampleSink` (holding only the stream continuation) from the
// refcon — never the actor, never the session.

// file_length / type_body_length are disabled: the actor's length is driven by the lifecycle-

// the start/stop logic cannot move to a sibling extension file without widening encapsulation —
// the existing +Configuration / +LiveSession splits work only because they touch `internal`
// surface. The catch-up clock + ingest logic requires access to the same private state and
// cannot be split without the same encapsulation cost.

/// A single-stream hardware HEVC encoder.
///
/// One instance encodes exactly one stream (screen OR camera). Frames enter via `ingest`;
/// the CFR clock fills slot gaps with synthetic holds; encoded HEVC samples leave on
/// `encodedSamples`; drops are reported on `drops`.
///
/// ### Constant-frame-rate driving (spec §CFR, OpAC-4.2/4.3)
/// The actor delegates every slot decision to `CFRNormalizer` and its catch-up API.
/// `ingest` calls `catchUpThenEncode`: it emits synthetic holds for any slots that elapsed
/// since the last emission and then encodes the real frame — real frames always win their
/// own slot. `clockTick()` (absolute-deadline loop, or tests via `clockTick(nowSeconds:)`)
/// calls `catchUpHolds` to fill slots that elapsed with no real frame (source silence /
/// static screen).
///
/// ### Anchored PTS (Decision #3 — critical)
/// The PTS handed to `encodeFrame` is the ABSOLUTE host-time value built with exact integer
/// CMTime math from the normalizer's integer `slotIndex` — see `anchoredPTS(slotIndex:)`.
///
/// ### One-shot lifecycle contract (for #34's author)
/// The encoder is ONE-SHOT: `init → start() → (ingest / clockTick)* → stop() → discard`.
/// - `start()` succeeds exactly once. A second `start()` — after a successful start, after
///   `stop()`, or after a failed (throwing) `start()` — throws `VideoEncoderError.invalidLifecycleState`.
///   A thrown `start()` is TERMINAL: the encoder cannot be revived; create a fresh instance.
/// - On any throwing exit from `start()` BOTH output streams (`encodedSamples`, `drops`) are
///   finished, so a consumer that subscribed before `start()` is never left hanging on the
///   HW-hard-fail path.
/// - `stop()` is an unconditional, idempotent terminator: it always finishes both streams even
///   if the session was never created.
/// Because no restart is possible, the internal `CFRNormalizer` is never reused across sessions —
/// the one-shot guarantee structurally removes the stale-normalizer class of bug.
