// #297 — impure GPU half of the camera-stabilization stage.
//
// `StabilizationStage` is the protocol seam between the orchestrating actor
// (`StabilizingVideoSource`) and the GPU work — the project's DI-seam pattern; the L2 decorator
// tests substitute a fake stage (a live Vision/Metal stack is untestable without hardware).
// `StabilizationRenderer` is the live implementation: Vision translational registration on an
// upscale + CoreImage translate/crop/scale-back render into a pooled NV12 buffer.
//
// file_length: the seam protocol, the error taxonomy it throws, and the live renderer form one
// GPU-boundary unit — a fake stage implements the protocol against exactly these errors, so
// splitting them apart would decouple the contract from its failure modes.
// swiftlint:disable file_length
//
// Isolation: (mirrors `LiveCompressionSession` / `VideoOutputShim`) a dedicated SERIAL
// DispatchQueue (`qos: .userInitiated`) owns every mutable field and executes all Vision/CI work —
// 30 ms of synchronous Vision per frame must never run in the Swift Concurrency cooperative pool
// (actor starvation). Async methods bridge onto the queue via `withCheckedContinuation`
// (checked, not unsafe; single in-flight is guaranteed by the caller's design: a depth-1 slot +
// a single work task). Only `CVPixelBuffer` references cross the bridge — the same read-only
// invariant `VideoFrame` documents for its `@unchecked Sendable`.
