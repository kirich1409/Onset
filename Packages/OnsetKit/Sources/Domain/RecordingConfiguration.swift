/// Describes a validation finding produced by the Validator (#31).

/// (`.frameRateClamped`, `.softwareEncoderOnly`) are informational and not errors;
/// conflating them with `Error` would be type-system misdirection. Rendering issue
/// cases as user-facing strings is the responsibility of the Presentation layer (#32).
///
/// `CMVideoDimensions` is not `Equatable` in the SDK, so `==` is implemented manually
/// on this enum via field-wise comparison (same pattern as `EncoderCapability`).
